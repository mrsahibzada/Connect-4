My diagonal check is doing some weird behaviour so I have commented it out.
Also, It is working fine on a single html page but using server somehow the second player's gamestate isn't forwarded to the first one.
Otherwise all was working fine before.. I have uploaded it as it is. Kindly tell me how can I improve it.
